you can create the dataype or domain of the attribute separately
CREATE DOMAIN SSN_TYPE AS CHAR(9).

another  type of constraint can restrict attribute or domain values using check values:
dNumber int not null check(dNumber > 30 and dNumber < 50);

create domain dNum as integer
check (dNum > 40 and dNum < 60);

LIKE operator 
like '%a%' exactly search a
like 'a%' exactly search a which comes at end.
like '%a' exactly search a which comes at start.
