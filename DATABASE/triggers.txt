creating a pk for a table using triggers
creating replica for the persons table 

two types of triggers dml and ddl

before dml trigger:
1. statement level triggers:
it is executed only once it is by default

code:
create or replace trigger emptrg before update on emp

begin

dbms_output.put_line('Record updated');

end;
/

2. row level trigger:
it is executed once for each row

code:

create or replace trigger trig2 before update on emp
for each row
begin 
dbms_output.put_line("Record updated");
end;
/


ddl trigger is created on database level

 create or replace trigger trig1
before drop on hr.schema
begin 
dbms_output.put_line("table dropped");
end;
/

bind variables :
:old   before executing dml statement, all data stored in 
in :old bind variable   
:new   after executing dml statement, all data stored in :new
bind variable.

realtime usage:
create sequence ac_seq;

create or replace trigger trigger_accs
before update on accounts for each row
begin
insert into transactions (tid, acno, tdate, amount, balanace)
values (ac_seq.nextval, :new.acno, sysdate, 
abs(:new.balance - :old.balance), :new.balance)
end;
